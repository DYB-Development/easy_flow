# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Flows and flow versions take a random code from the public_code gem. In an app that has run the `AddPublicCodeToEasyFlowDefinitions` and `AddPublicCodeToEasyFlowVersions` migrations, every flow management address carries the flow's code, returning to an earlier version is addressed by that version's code, and a numbered flow address is not found.
- An app that has not run those migrations keeps addressing and finding flows and versions by id exactly as before.

### Upgrading

To switch an app's flows and versions to codes, copy and run the new migrations, then restart the app:

```
bin/rails easy_flow:install:migrations
bin/rails db:migrate
```

A host that finds an easy_flow flow by its address, such as alembic, has to move to a release that finds it by code at the same time.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-10-12

### Added

- Flow runs take a random code from the public_code gem. In an app that has run the `AddPublicCodeToEasyFlowRuns` migration, every run address carries the run's code, runs are found by it, and a numbered run address is not found.
- An app that has not run that migration keeps addressing and finding runs by id exactly as before.

### Upgrading

To switch an app's runs to codes, copy and run the new migration, then restart the app:

```
bin/rails easy_flow:install:migrations
bin/rails db:migrate
```

A host that overrides `run_address` and `find_run` keeps the addresses it builds.
